# OpenAIRecommender

A book recommender web application. However,instead of your typical machine learning algorithm, we used OpenAI's API to recommend books for users instead. This the core of this project consists of a Spring Boot backend and a React Frontend.

## Architecture/ How this works

![Alt Text](./public/newgateway.png)


I wanted to develop a mini-microservice archictecture with two services. Heres a general overview of the overall architecture.

| Service   | Purpose  |
|------------|------------|
| SessionService   | User Sessions are stored redis through Spring Boots HTTPsession. These sessions are used to persist the users books. Acts as a client to the ReccommenderApplication   |
| ReccommenderService   | Caller of the OpenAI API. Takes the current session from the SessionApplication and responds with a list of recommendations for the user.    |
| API Gateway   | Simply for API routing purposes. Not needed but wanted to try it out for the project  |

These are all run in docker containers which will be explained below.




## Run Locally

This project can be easily setup using a docker-compose command. However, since we are using the OpenAI API, you will first need to setup the application.properties file in the recc/src/main/resources directory.

1.First clone application locally
\`\`\`bash
  git clone https://github.com/cakuang1/movierec.git
  \`\`\`

2.Replace the openai.api.key value in your application.properties file
\`\`\`python
openai.model=gpt-3.5-turbo
openai.api.url=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
openai.api.key=YOURAPIKEYHERE
server.port=8081
\`\`\`


3;.Now  to the project directory

\`\`\`bash
  cd movierec
  \`\`\`

4.Run the docker compose commnad

\`\`\`bash
  docker compose up
\`\`\`

| Service            | Port(s)       | Description                              |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| redis            | 6379          | Redis service for caching.               |
| moviemanagement  | 8080          | Spring Boot application for movie management, depends on Redis. |
| recc            | 8081          | Reccomendation service (OpenAI  )    |
| apigateway       | 8085          | API Gateway service, dependent on Redis.                        |
| frontend         | 3000          | Frontend service for your application.                            |

These following services will be now running.

5.Now you are able to view to web application by going to http://localhost:3000/
