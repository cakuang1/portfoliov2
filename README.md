# Serverless Resume


## Overview

This portfolio showcases my journey through the Cloud Resume Challenge, a project designed to demonstrate proficiency in various cloud technologies and services while creating a professional online presence. This challenge was not just about building a resume but also about showcasing my skills in cloud computing.


## What I Accomplished and Learned

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** I've automated the deployment of my resume website using Terraform. This ensures that I can easily recreate my infrastructure if needed.

- **Serverless Functions:** I've implemented serverless functions that map to my API endpoints that serve as communication to DynamoDB.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** I've set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to frequently test and deploy my applications on pushes to the main branch.


- **Cloud Services:** I've utilized various cloud services like AWS S3 for static website hosting, AWS API Gateway for RESTful APIs, and AWS DynamoDB for data storage.
